## How high should I aim?

So one of the major things holding me back so far is "how high should I aim?". I think of myself as a rather pragmatic developer. I don't want to make anything more complicated than it has to be. Part of learning that skill is noticing simplifications in a system. In my research for instance, I could make an online or mobile interface for performing the intervention demonstration. But technically, I'm not evaluating the effect of the *interface* on the performance on our navigation or learning. So why bother? Just use rviz or other existing tools, right? These are the kinds of simplications I am seeing. Here are a few of them I can think of right now:

 - Use rviz and existing ros tools for performing the demonstration *or* writing a web or mobile interface
 - Using hand selected heuristics for learning *or* dynamically learning heuristics.
 - Using `move_base` and the default global/local planners, and learning by improving costmaps *or* using `gmapping` and combine other heuristics to and write my own planner
 - On the line of writing my own trajectory planners, should I write plugins to `nav_core` *or* should I make it isolated?
 - Should I do some of the experiments in simulation *or* all of them *or* none of them?
 - On the topic of simulation, do I need to use the vector robot *or* can I just use turtlebot
