Just one thought I had about the learning stuff. If we decrease the cost at some location because we've demonstrated there, but then an obstacle appears in or near that area we could be in trouble. This initially didn't seem like an issue, but now I realize it's incredibly likely. Areas where we get stuck are most likely to be areas that are changing. If someone moves a trash can, we have to consider that. Therefore, I undertand why MHA-star is a good idea. The alternative is making a layer in the costmap that DWA planner will then use to adjust it's plan. However, MHA is different. It uses multiple heuristics and consideres them differently, or something like that? I'm thinking maybe MHA-star will do a better job when there is a conflict of interest between demonstration and new obstacles.
