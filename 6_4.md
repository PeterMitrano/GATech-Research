After reading the multi-heuristic A-star paper and parts of two other papers on LfD and RL in mobile robot navigation, I have some new thoughts.

## Multi-Heuristic A-Star
It seems to me that MHA-star would be a global-planner in the ros nav stack. So in theory I could implement MHA-star and then edit the stanley launch files to use my global planner by settings the `base_global_planner` on the ROS parameter server when launching the `move_base` node. I believe in the paper they manually define what the heuristics are. They used a 2D Dijkstra's heuristic for h0, and "For generating the additional heuristics, [they] used two strategies, dual heuristics: where [they] generated an extra heuristic by (h1) performing another 2D Dijkstra search by inflating the obstacles using the robotâ€™s outradius, and progressive heuristics (h2): where the 2D Dijkstra path obtained for h0 is investigated for possible bottlenecks, if the path has narrow passages, those are blocked and a new heuristic is computed." So in their experiment they picked out features known to cause issues, and created additional heuristics for them. This is one approach. For instance, I think their second additional heuristic (h2) is clever. We could also add one the avoid doorways where people might be coming quickly out of doors, or corners where people might come rushing around them. These types of heuristics require labeling the environment, or hard-coding them in advance. This is acceptable for static features like doors and corners, but does not generalize well. Another option would be to have the demonstrator label these features at demonstration time. This brings of course begs the question "can we classify these features with our sensing and perception capabailities autonomously?". That is an interesting question, but may or may not be outside the scope of this research.

If we choose not to autonomously detect features, we rely on static or annotated features to build additional heuristics. In other words, the costmaps that feed into the MHA-star planner I may write would be based on me hard-coding locations of features, or from adding or removing features during demonstrations. This is still useful, and can still improve navigation over time.

Ok so I literally just found this...
