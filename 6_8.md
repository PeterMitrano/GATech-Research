## more nav notes

setting `xy_goal_tolerance` too low means you will spin when you get really near your goal. This is fixed by setting XY tolerance to 0.15 or greater

setting `path_distance_bias` too high in relation to `goal_distance_bias` causes complex unexpected scenarios to fail. For insance, a random new obstacle blocking the global plan's path. The 5:2 ration of path to goal which is default was far too high. I suspect a 5:5 or 5:4 reatio is better overall. The absolute value seems to also matter. Making the values 50 and 40 seems to be drastically different than 5 and 4.
