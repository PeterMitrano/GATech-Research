I met with Dr Chernova yesterday to figure where to start. I didn't share any of what I had done, since it was kinda me messing around until we met. She suggested that I look at getting Prentice's navigation up and running, and figure out where we are. How good is it now? When does it get stuck? I agreed with this, and so today I got the teleop and autonomous slam demos provided by Stanley Innovation up. They work, but I'm not impressed by the drive base a whole. It's very noisy, and on carpet it vibrates at high speed, and when strafing. Sonia also said I should read a few papers. The first is on "Multi-Heuristic A Star". At first I read it and didn't understand why she had me read it. However, I realize now how it applies. As we receive demonstrations, we will be looking at various features of our state, and trying to improve in similar situations in the future. One of the ways to improve, is to simply avoid the mistake in the first place. In other words, we can have a heuristic for some or all of the features we are considering, and consider those in our path finding. Another paper I will read is one mentioned in her Survey of LfD paper, which is about path planning, and uses 2d hand drawn paths as corrections or suggestions to the robot.

I also learned that _getting stuck on a random cable_ is a perfectly valid reason for failure.
