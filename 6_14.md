## Navigation progress

Navigation is performing very well. Sending it back and forth to various locations across the small office map 20 times showed no complete failures. Recovery behaviors are significantly improving the performance. I think it's time to spend a whole day doing some serious benchmarking. I want to look at interventions per run as my metric, as well as average velocity.

## Learning progess

I'm still very uncertain about how I want to approach navigaton. It is very redundant, but I'll quickly outline the key decisions again:

Do we want to learn based on the path taken during demonstrations? Do we want to *predict* how to escape novel failure scenarios?
Do we want to learn based on locations of failure? Do we want to *predict* locations that also might fail, and if so, how?
Some of these questions require classifying or extracting features from locations on our map. What kinds of features can we look at?

One interesting thing to think about for learning is what if do simulation of cost of maving in various directions as a way of classifying failures? Like if you can't translate side to side, but you can go forward or backwards you're probably somewhere narrow and you should just try to align yourself. This would kind of be like using costmaps to classify? I don't think that makes any sense.

Also the max margin planning paper is too complicated for me to understand well enough to implement, so I might need some help on that.
