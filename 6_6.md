## Meeting summary

I met with Dr. Chernova today before she leaves for vacation, and here is a summary of what we talked about:

 1. Simulation will be useful at some point, so we should make it work
 1. We want to tune navigation reasonably well so that we aren't trying to solve artificial problems. The planner failing in an empty hallway, and other silly things should not be the cause for errors
 1. We don't care that much about interface, but eventually we want some kind of notification system so I know when ther robot fails.

## Goals for the week

 1. Create a good map of part of the floor, and tune navigation as best as possible
 1. Read the paper on Dyanmic Multi-Heuristic A-Star
 1. Make simple two-path route where one will always get the robot stuck
 1. Imlpement SMHA-Star as a global planner plugin for `move_base`, or use it to plan waypoints

## Stuff I did today

 1. Found author's implementation of MHA-Star!!!
 1. Made a global planner plugin that include mhaplanner (from above)
 1. Made a good map of the first square of the office and learned lots of stuff about vector/nav
   1. We should make a straffing recovery behavior. It gets stuck on corners a lot
   1. We should avoid corners more
   1. We literally drive straight at a 15 degree angle. I mean, yea holonomic is cool, but I think Prentice is just showing off.
