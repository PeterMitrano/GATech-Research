# Status update

Ok, so yesterday I showed the MHA does produce sane paths, but it doesn't know about obstacles. It also doesn't produce *optimal* paths. They're very very curvy. This is sometimes good and results in a faster path, but sometimes not. I'm wondering if MHA is capable of turning in place without moving forward. It may not be...

My demonstration_layer plugin works! It's functionality is limited to two constant cost values, and there is no smoothing. Also, once a cost is decreased it stays that way forever and doesn't improve. I also need to remap the other lab because it got completely rearranged and it's fucking up localization. Or, maybe that's an opportunity to demonstrate/test? I'm not sure.

Other things:
 - Recovery supervisor now looks at number of instances of recovery behavior, not distance/time. This is a _much_ better method
 - Recovery supervisor still has some bugs where if it fails and you re-send a goal it will sometimes still fail the robot immediately
 - Nav Points is a new thing I created that literally just puts a few fixed arrows for sending goals repeatably.

# Thoughts and contemplations moving forward

So what I realized last night is that I don't have a reproducible failure case. I just don't have one, and making one up seems stupid. So, because recovery behavior is good enough to fix most scenarios, why don't we move to attacking recovery behavior happening in the first place. Instead of waiting for total failure, just wait for one single recovery behavior. However, do not cancel the nav goal on one recovery--wait for two for that (even 3, who cares...).

# Misc

We need to store the goal associated with demonstrated trajectories.
