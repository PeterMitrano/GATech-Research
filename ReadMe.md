# My Research

This document is meant to outline and track the work I do this summer (2017) at Georgia Tech, working in Dr Chernova's RAIL Lab.

## Initial problem statement

The overall challenge is to apply LfD techniques to autonomous mobile robots that currently receive human-intervention in the event of failure to complete a task. One example is with delivery robots in hospitals, where failure is not tolerable. If the robot gets stuf or confused, a human operator takes over. We see this human intervention as a "demonstration" from which the robot should be able to learn. If a robot encounters the same issue, it should be able to overcome it with little or no intervention.
