## It's a new week!!! Only 6 weeks left...

Over the weekend I modified recovery_supervisor and points_to_path. I can now give a demonstrated path in Rviz, and that path is published appropriately. So if I'm taking the simplest route possible, the next step is to write a costmap layer that subscribes to this path and reduces the cost in those areas.
