## Lasers/Localization

I need to tune and improve localization if it makes any of my experiments not work well. It's also just a good thing to do. One option is to make a better map. Another option is to tune the amcl parameters. A third option is to get a second lidar.

#### Build a better map.

This is pretty easy to do, so I should try it

#### Tune AMCL

Last resport

#### Get another lidar

It seems that amcl and gmapping might be able to handle two lidars. If they use the frame_id in the header of the LaserScan message then it should work. I have not found many things *recently* on the subject.

## Other Non-Learning stuff

#### Local planning and behavior.

There are obviously still a ton of obnoxious issues with navigation. First off, it never turns left. Second, it thinks it can't turn when it can (but rotate recovery alows it to turn). Third, we'd have more success if it turned fully before moving forward. Fourth, the stagnation detection isn't flawless, and isn't a great method for failure detection. Also publishing the costmap more frequently might be a good idea. I believe that is possible.

#### Global planning

 The global cost map obstacle layer never decreases, and doesn't understand doors. There should be additional inflation around other things that is just preference, instead of just lethal or not. So obstalces in the global planner are necessary but they should be confidence based. If you see them they should go up to lethal but over time they should decrease


## The data I collected

I need to comb through the examples I collected and do two things.

 1. Identify two or three interesting scenarios where failure is legitimate, and learning the most appropriate solution
 1. Identify uninteresting failures into different categories, and show where they usually occur
