# Status update

Ok, so I've made a ton of excellent tools/software changes recently so let's summarize those before we move on to tricky stuff and research.

## Nav Points

nav points now contains two nodes, one for markers and sending goals, and one for continuous goal navigation. nav_points (the c++ node) now takes sends goals from clicked markers (whose poses come from the parameter server). But, you can also send it a number (the goal index in that parameter server) and it will send the goal all the same. The second new node, cantstopwontstop, takes advantage of this. It listens to move base, and whenever it receaches a goal, it can automatically set a new goal. It has a two parameters:

 ~pause_time                how long to pause between goals
 ~wait_for_confirmation     wait for me to hit the enter key between goals

## Recovery Supervisor

Ok lots of changes here...

 - Added localization jump detection. Sends cancel message immediately. never cancels for any other reason. there's a parameter to set the threshold distance for this behavior.
 - change how `has_goal_` is determined. new goal is detected by listening to `/move_base_simple/goal`. `has_goal_` is true from that point, until it either aborts, or reaches the goal.
 - We now only listen to the first msg coming from `move_base/status`. This might cause issues, but I haven't seen any yet. This just simplifies the code
 - always log odom

## Summary of the situation

so now if you want to run and record all things navigation:

** on vector **
`roslaunch vector_navigation_apps rail.launch`

** off vector **
```
roslaunch vector_remote_teleop vector_remote_teleop.launch #optional, just for joystick teleop
roslaunch vector_viz view_robot.launch #not optional. you need to set initial pose.

# this last command launches goal markers and runs recovery supervisor which bags stuff and handles demonstrations
roslaunch recovery_supervisor vector.launch
```
