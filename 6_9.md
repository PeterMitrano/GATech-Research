...continuing the bring dump from yesterday...

So that'so ne easy way to get the behavior Sonia described. And that would be an achievement. But that's certainly not learning from demonstration. That's reinforcement learning. What we want more than just avoiding bad spots, is the ability to *recover* from situations where we are stuck. This is making me think of one of the papers I read which describes seeding a MDP from demonstration. I think it was [this one](http://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/papers/2002/SmartKaelbling-ICRA2002.pdf). This isn't to say I think it's a waste to do what I'm talking about with updating the global cost map and learning from getting stuck. I just think there are better ways to solve the overall problem of autonomous robot navigation. For instance, if we could derive an algorithm to classify areas in the map geometrically, then when we found we repeatedly got stuck in one class/type of area, we could inflate the cost of that same feature/class/type other places in the map. That's really interesting, and definitely is learning. In fact, that algorithm to classify could just be the demonstrators labeling things. But then, why not just have all that information labeled ahead of time. It would be pretty easy to do that. Maybe the labeling by a demonstrator is simply reinforcement or supervision. We still try to learn features about the environment that will likely make navigation fail. So we could do it autonomously, and just get some extra feedback from the demonstrator. But still that doesn't address the issue of getting ourselves un-stuck. Yes, it will prevent us from getting stuck in the first place, but it is also worth investigating if there's ways we can learn **from the demonstration itself**, which would allow us to recover on our own in novel situations.

Ok that was a lot of thinking... time to set some goals.

## Goals for today

 - print a new paper to read
 - Write a straffing recovery behavior for Prentice
 - Make simulated Prentice drive in gazebo. literally any motion at all is good
